# Travis Deploy Scripts

This is a small redirect app that takes the deploy information (app name,
environment and Heroku ID) and shows the right deployment log.

It's currently a very small app, but the URLs are extensible to add more
providers other than Heroku.

## Installation and usage

### Setup

    $ bundle install

### Run the server

    $ script/server
